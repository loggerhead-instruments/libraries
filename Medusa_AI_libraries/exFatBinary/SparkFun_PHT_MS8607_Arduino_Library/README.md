# SparkFun MS8607 Combined Pressure, Humidity and Temperature Sensor Arduino Library

The MS8607 is a very sensitive, fully calibrated, low power, easy to use, combined pressure, humidity and temperature sensor.
It is perfect for home weather stations, detecting changes in altitude, and pneumatic based switches or actuators.
The pressure sensor will operate down to 10mbar which is equivalent to an altitude of approx. 31,000m making it suitable for high altitude ballooning
and other low pressure applications.

The original manufacturer TE has written a [great Arduino library](https://github.com/TEConnectivity/MS8607_Arduino_Library) for the device.
We've added a heap of examples and new functions to make the sensor even easier to use, plus an example showing how to connect the board to one of the
alternative I2C ports on the Artemis.
